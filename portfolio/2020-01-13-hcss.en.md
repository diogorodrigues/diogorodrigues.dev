## About the project

During my work at DYD Agency based in Houston, Texas, I had the opportunity to plan and define the technologies for the development of this website, whose objective is to present a list of the company's opening jobs, in addition to providing relevant content to its users. I also helped in planning the interface, defining the details of design and usability.

## Result

The goal was to develop a WordPress theme that could be easily used by the company. So, in addition to using the Genesis framework to maintain code consistency and thereby improve its maintenance, we also use the WPBakery Page Builder plugin to help maintain content.

The site is fully responsive and has several technologies in front-end development: use of Atomic Design, BEM and Stylus for the creation of CSS, as well as modularization of javascript using Gulp (a task runner built on Node.js and npm).
