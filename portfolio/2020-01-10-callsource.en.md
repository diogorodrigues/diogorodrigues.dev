## About the project

The creation of this site involved a great team and all its content and technologies were very well planned. The company operates in the data area and aimed at a WordPress site that is easy to maintain and that could present all its services in a simple and attractive way.

## Result

The result was the creation of a theme in Wordpress using technologies such as the Genesis framework to maintain the consistency and maintenance of the code, as well as fully modularized code using the Task Runner Gulp: use of Atomic Design, BEM and Stylus for CSS, creation of JS modules, image optimization. In addition, the site also has only a few essential plugins, including the WP Bakery Page Builder to facilitate content maintenance.
