__It has been a little over a week since I arrived in Dublin, Ireland, and there are so many possibilities in my life from now on that I still need to spend time planning calmly. This is amazing.__

Being here was a decision to improve my English and have new opportunities in my career and personal life. It is also part of a dream that I have been imagining for years. For a long time I have been planning to move from Brazil and, even in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, I see that this is my time. Having lived in Canada for a few months in 2018 and then working for a company based in Houston, USA helped me get here with a good level of English and more "comfortable" with the culture shock that I will face at the beginning.

Having made the decision to come here is a long story that I intend to tell gradually during my journey here on the Emerald Island. I also want to share a little of what I will experience here: looking for jobs, studying, getting used to a new culture, pandemic, future plans... There are so many things that I don't know where to start.

A brief summary of my journey is that it all started with my desire to live in London. I have always been passionate about the medieval stories that date back to England in its early days. But living there has its financial challenges. And that's when I got to know Ireland and I was enchanted by everything I had been researching about the country: here I can work as a student, visit castles, get to know a descendant culture of the Vikings, live among lively people, and lastly but not least, it is close to London ... In addition, there are also many big and famous technology companies here: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Hubspot, AirBnb ... There are those who risk saying that here is a type of silicon valley European.

See you next time! ‚ú®üòÅ
