## About me

<p class="text-hilight"><strong>Hi, I'm Diona Rodrigues</strong>, a brazilian <span class='text-line'>web designer</span> front-end developer with UI/UX design skills (<a href='/blog/which-type-of-frontend-devoloper-am-i'><strong>front-end designer</strong></a>) based in Dublin, Ireland.</p>

Enthusiastic front-end developer with 10 years of experience in building and maintaining modern and user-focused interfaces.

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

I had many opportunities in my previous jobs to develop strong UI / UX design skills and I also participated in large projects such as HP Life and Nike ecommerce Brazil.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm playing the violin, studying languages or simply reading a good book.
